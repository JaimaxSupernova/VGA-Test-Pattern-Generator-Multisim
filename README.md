# CE264 Multisim Designs

This repository contains all Multisim files for my CE264 (Digital System Design) project. The project focuses on FPGA-based digital system design, including:

## Features
- **7-Segment Display Driver**
- **VGA Driver** (HS & VS Synchronization)
- **VGA Test Pattern Implementation**

Each stage is designed in Multisim, generating VHDL files opened with Vivado for FPGA implementation.

## Usage
- Open the Multisim files to explore the designs, VGAdrivernew.ms14 is the top-level module for the design.
- Export VHDL files for FPGA implementation in Vivado.
